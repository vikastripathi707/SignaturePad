# Project Name: Signature Pad


## Description: 

_Signature Pad is a simple web application that allows users to draw signatures using their mouse or input. The application provides options to change the text, background color, font size, giving users the flexibility to customize their signature to their liking. Users can clear the canvas at any time and start over, or save their signature as an image file for future use. The application also allows users to retrieve previously saved signatures from local storage and display them on the canvas._

_The application uses the HTML5 Canvas API for drawing on the canvas and the FileSaver.js library for saving the signature as an image file. The code also uses local storage to save and retrieve previously saved signatures._
